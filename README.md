# portrait-vis
The intermediate outputs and visualization code for a final project for ENGLISH 590: Quantifying Literature.  

Because Henry James's *The Portrait of a Lady* is in the public domain the only file I have omitted from this repository is the PDF list of textual variants from [this edition of the book](https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/abs/portrait-of-a-lady/textual-variants/043E375660B293FE913A585215206122) because the changelist is supplemented with editorial material under copyright.
